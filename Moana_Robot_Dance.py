# The letter is the pitch. The first number is the octave.
# The second number is how long the note is held.
# Ex:"B4/8" 
# B4: The pitch B in the 4th octave. In scientific pitch notation, (and on the
# piano and other istruments) this is just below middle C (C4).
#/8: Indicates that the note should be played as an eighth note, 
# meaning it lasts for one-eighth the duration of a whole note.
